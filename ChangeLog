Version 1.6.1 - 2024-03-25

- "--sql" is now the default (and replaced with "--nosql")
- Downloads mood information for the given user
- Downloads tag statistics for the given user

Version 1.6 - 2024-03-24

- Adding a "--sql" option, which stores everything (entries,
  comments, userpic metadata, sync status) in an sqlite database.
  The only things not stored there are the userpic files,
  e.g. good_day.png, cool_entry.gif.  Those are written as files.
  The database can be manipulated with all the usual tools.
  This is a bit more portable format for people with a lot of
  entries and comments.

Version 1.5.2 - 2020-01-01

- Prompt for alternative server, defaulting to LJ
- Use "clear" auth method, since Dreamwidth has dropped challenge
  auth; the challenge method is incompatible with secure password
  handling on the server.
- Correspondingly, default all URLs to https: to protect passwords
  in transit.
- Bugfix: GUI was ignoring "journal" field
- Add --quiet option to suppress log messages
- Allow config file to omit password, in which case ljdump will
  prompt for it
